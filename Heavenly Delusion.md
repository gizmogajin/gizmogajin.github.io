Remarks : Very entertaining. But very dark story. Animations and character designs are not suited for the disturbing story . This makes its both interesting and unique.
Notes : 
Synopsis : Within the safety of the walls, youths are raised in a nursery setting by robots. Outside is a hellscape with powerful technology and equally powerful super-natural beings.
