# Mysteries

- [x] Episode 1  - Why did christina say okabe tried to say something to her 15 mins ago. Also what actually happened in Episode 1 , all very confusing
- [x] What's the recurring Space Ship that crashed
- [x] Who originally gave the shrine IBM and later how did it go missing.
	- Feyris/Feyris father gave the IBM and Moeka's D-Mail sent herself in the past the location of IBM so she took it.
- [x] Who is the stalker okabe faced in the early episodes. One who sent him beheaded heads pictures.
	- It was Braun/Moeka trying to scare Okabe in to dropping his research on time travel.
- [x] What is the meaning of the words suzuha said to moeka when moeka attacked the lab
	- The words were *"42 CRT ..... It's on"*. Suzuha said that the tv at Braun's shop is on and ready for time leap.
- [x] Episode 13 - How did okabe manage to get away from Shining Finger the second time they were attacked ? Unrealistic ?
	- *He is not fated to die in that time due to convergence, he can run away from anyone firing at him without being mortally wounded. the reason he can't die is because he already died in 2025 in the future. It is written in history and they are still part of that world line even when time-leaping. It would create a paradox otherwise*
- [x] Whats up with time stopping whenever mayuri die ?
	- *The stopping of the hourglass and Mayuri's pocket watch didn't occur in the Visual Novel, it's just a visual representation brought into the anime to convey that something's wrong. It has no bearing on the story and shouldn't be looked into too deeply, it's just a metaphor*
- [x] How okabe got the reading steiner ? when he got fever when he was a kid ?
	- *I think that he was just born with Reading Steiner. As i understood it, the reason he was sick during Y2K wasn't because he was acquiring Reading Steiner, but rather it was his Reading Steiner taking effect. As we are told in the series by Suzuha, there are events that change the future so drastically, that they shift into a new attractor field, and as an example she gave Y2K. It would make sense that during these events, Okabes brain goes under alot of stress(we see that during the 1st episode, there was also a shift in attractor fields, and as a result he experienced much more stronger effects of his Reading Steiner, than he did during simple World Line shifts.), and that stress was probably the reason for his illness.*
- [x] who is FB
	- Braun
- [ ] Ep 20, in the end, kurise seems to know about the first d mail and her getting stabbed and also seemed fine and happy with reverting back to that timeline.
- [x] how did okabe make the time machine to begin with
	- It was coincidental. *they just wanted to remote control the microwave and ended up creating a time machine. (because they didn't handle the case where people would input #00:00:00 instead of 00:00:00#)*
- [x] what are d mails ?
- [x] importance of IBM ?
	- To access Jellyman Reports of SERN and also access ECHELON database 
- [x] why their d mails are in SERN's database ?
	- Because of ECHELON system of SERN
- [x] what is steins gate
	- Made up name by Okabe. Also means *fate* in most occasions when Okabe says it. Also the future Okabe termed it as the best possible timeline , that is a timeline where neither Mayuri or Kurisu dies.
- [ ] Ep 22 , After deleting the first d mail from SERN database and the time leap , mayuri seems to know everything that happened. how ?
- [x] Ep 23, how did the metal upa save the papers
	- *itâ€™s the metal Upa that triggers the metal detector when Nakabachi flees for Russia. The Upa and the theory paper was together, so Nakabachi carried the papers on his person. When the cargo caught fire, the paper was not destroyed and Russia gets the theory. If the Upa was plastic, it would not have triggered the metal detector and the Upa along with the theory paper went into the cargo. Which caught fire and was destroyed. So Russia never gets the paper.*
