Remarks : Story not bad. Loved the musicals. Animation is the pinnacle of all anime. Not my cup of tea. Mostly romance.
Notes : 
Synopsis : Mitsuha and Taki are two total strangers living completely different lives. But when Mitsuha makes a wish to leave her mountain town and for the bustling city of Tokyo, they become connected in a bizarre way. She dreams she is a boy living in Tokyo while Taki dreams he is a girl from a rural town he’s never been to. What does their newfound connection mean? And how will it bring them together?
